### Guidelines:
- Make sure to always create a branch for whatever you're working on;
- Name your branch using common convention: user_story_number-descriptive_title-initials eg: "11-hadoop-data-gathering-az"
- Clean, readable code; don't overload your code with too many comments, and use comments above statements NOT inline
- Commit messages are mandatory for every commit just so we can easily understand what we're all trying to do (and for PRs if we need them)

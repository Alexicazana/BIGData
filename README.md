### Guidelines for Clean(ish) coding:
- Make sure to always create a branch for whatever you're working on;
- Name your branch using common convention: user_story_number-descriptive_title-initials eg: "11-hadoop-data-gathering-az"
- Clean, readable code; don't overload your code with too many comments, and use comments above statements NOT inline
- Commit messages are mandatory for every commit just so we can easily understand what we're all trying to do (and for PRs if we need them)
- Create Issues for major stories/features; allows us to clearly define what we're working on before writing any code, keep track of progress, stay organized and makes it easier for us to help each other if need be

## Project Abstract: Enhancing Educational Content Accessibility through Summarization and Categorization with Unsupervised Learning on the Cosmopedia Dataset

### Project Definition

This project intends to  categorize educational content through unsupervised machine learning techniques. Utilizing the Cosmopedia dataset—a comprehensive collection of synthetic textbooks, blog posts, and stories—the project aims to perform accurate categorization across a spectrum of academic disciplines and educational tiers.  

### Dataset and Characteristics

The Cosmopedia dataset features 25 billion tokens across 30 million files generated by Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1. The focus will be on the 'stanford', 'openstax', and 'khanacademy' splits, which respectively include 1.02M, 125k, and 24.1k rows of promoted educational content featuring the following column names:

  - text_token_length: The number of tokens in the generated text, computed using Mixtral's tokenizer.
  - prompt: The initial prompt used to generate the content.
  - text: The synthetic content generated in response to the prompt.
  - seed_data: The name of the dataset or external source that inspired the prompt.
  - format: The style of the text, indicating whether it's a textbook, blog post, story, etc.
  - audience: The target audience for the content, as specified in the prompt.

This consistent structure across the splits facilitates a streamlined approach to processing and analyzing the dataset, laying the groundwork for our categorization efforts.

### Research Questions

1. How accurately can unsupervised learning techniques categorize synthetic education content?

### Models and Algorithms

The project employs an unsupervised approach:

1. Unsupervised Learning for Topic Discovery and Clustering: Employing algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and K-means clustering to identify similar content 

2. NLP Models: Leveraging transformer-based models like T5 and BERT, fine-tuned to label clusters.


### Comparative Analysis

The project assesses the impact of unsupervised clustering on the efficiency and accuracy of content categorization. Evaluation metrics will focus on   the precision of categorization (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score), showcasing the effectiveness of combining unsupervised and supervised learning techniques in managing educational content.

By integrating detailed insights from unsupervised learning with the power of NLP and machine learning, this project will attempt to elevate the accessibility and organization of digital educational materials, providing a transformative tool for students, educators, and content developers alike.

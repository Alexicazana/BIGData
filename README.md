### Guidelines for Clean(ish) coding:
- Make sure to always create a branch for whatever you're working on;
- Name your branch using common convention: user_story_number-descriptive_title-initials eg: "11-hadoop-data-gathering-az"
- Clean, readable code; don't overload your code with too many comments, and use comments above statements NOT inline
- Commit messages are mandatory for every commit just so we can easily understand what we're all trying to do (and for PRs if we need them)
- Create Issues for major stories/features; allows us to clearly define what we're working on before writing any code, keep track of progress, stay organized and makes it easier for us to help each other if need be

## Project Abstract: Enhancing Educational Content Accessibility through Summarization and Categorization with Unsupervised Learning on the Cosmopedia Dataset

### Project Definition

This project proposes an innovative approach to summarizing and categorizing educational content by harnessing both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. Utilizing the expansive Cosmopedia dataset—a comprehensive collection of synthetic textbooks, blog posts, and stories—the project aims to distill concise summaries and perform accurate categorization across a spectrum of academic disciplines and educational tiers. A pivotal addition to our methodology is the incorporation of unsupervised learning for automatic topic discovery and clustering, which promises to revolutionize the way educational materials are processed, accessed, and leveraged.

### Dataset and Characteristics

The Cosmopedia dataset features 25 billion tokens across 30 million files generated by the advanced Mixtral model. The focus will be on the 'stanford', 'openstax', and 'khanacademy' splits, which offer a rich collection of uniformly structured educational content featuring the following column names:

- `text_token_length`: The number of tokens in the generated text, computed using Mixtral's tokenizer.
- `prompt`: The initial prompt used to generate the content.
- `text`: The synthetic content generated in response to the prompt.
- `seed_data`: The name of the dataset or external source that inspired the prompt.
- `format`: The style of the text, indicating whether it's a textbook, blog post, story, etc.
- `audience`: The target audience for the content, as specified in the prompt.

This consistent structure across the splits facilitates a streamlined approach to processing and analyzing the dataset, laying the groundwork for our summarization and categorization efforts.

### Research Questions

1. Main: How can unsupervised learning techniques, through topic discovery and clustering, unveil thematic structures within a vast dataset of educational content?
2. In what ways do these thematic insights contribute to the enhancement of content summarization and categorization?
3. OVERALL, MAIN RESEARCH QUESTION: How can unsupervised learning techniques, through topic discovery and clustering, unveil thematic structures within a vast dataset of educational content, and are these thematic insights able to contribute to the enhancement of content summarization and categorization?

### Models and Algorithms

The project employs a hybrid model approach, integrating unsupervised and supervised learning techniques:

1. **Unsupervised Learning for Topic Discovery and Clustering:** Employing algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and K-means clustering to identify and group content based on underlying topics, which will inform the summarization and categorization processes.

2. **Summarization Models:** Leveraging transformer-based models like T5 and BERT, fine-tuned to summarize educational content by incorporating thematic insights derived from unsupervised learning.

3. **Categorization Models:** Implementing supervised algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests, for content classification, enhanced by the topic-aware features generated through unsupervised learning.

### Comparative Analysis

The project includes a rigorous comparative analysis, assessing the impact of unsupervised topic discovery and clustering on the efficiency and accuracy of content summarization and categorization. Evaluation metrics will focus on the quality of summaries (coherence, fidelity) and the precision of categorization (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score), showcasing the effectiveness of combining unsupervised and supervised learning techniques in managing educational content.

By integrating detailed insights from unsupervised learning with the power of NLP and machine learning, this project will attempt to elevate the accessibility and organization of digital educational materials, providing a transformative tool for students, educators, and content developers alike.
